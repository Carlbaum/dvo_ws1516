All our code is in ./code/src
The project can be compiled with
make all
make cublas
make noncublas
Some options can be passed along to the corresponding executables:
-path ../data/rgbd_corresponding_uncompressed_dataset
-tDistWeights 1 | tDistWeights 0 to enable|disable t-Distribution weights

Take a look at the scripts
./code/src/run_all.sh
./code/data/test_many.sh
They could be handy

The visualization code of ./Matlab plots a 3D trajectory,
but it is not polished and requires some hand-work for
timestamp alignment.

The folders in results are the result of running the test_many.sh script.
